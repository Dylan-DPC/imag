    imag - the personal information management suite for the commandline

    imag is a PIM suite for the commandline. It consists of several commands,
    called "modules". Each module implements one PIM aspect and all of these
    modules can be used independently.

    Available commands:
    $(for cmd in $cmds; do
        echo -e "\t$(echo $cmd | sed -r 's,(.*)/imag-(.*),\2,')";
    done)

    Call a command with "imag <command> <args>"
    Each command can be called with "--help" to get the respective helptext.

    Please visit https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/imag to view the source code,
    follow the development of imag or maybe even contribute to imag.

    imag is free software. It is released under the terms of LGPLv2.1
