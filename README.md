# imag

Imag is a CLI PIM suite with a nice API-ish commandline interface, so you can
integrate it in your tools of coice (Editor, MUA, RSS reader, etc etc).

For detailed information, please read [the documentation](./doc/) (You can
either read the Markdown files or compile it to HTML/PDF using
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org)).

_Nothing here yet. This is about to be written as soon as there is a working
base implemented._
