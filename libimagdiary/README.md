## libimagdiary

This library crates implements a full diary.

One can have one or more diaries in the store, each diary can have unlimited
entries.

### Future plans

The diary should be able to provide _daily_, _hourly_ and even _minutely_
diary entries, so one can use the diary as normal "Dear diary,
today..."-diary, or more fine-grained and more like a journal.

The internal file format as well as the store-path generation for this module is
prepared for such functionality.
