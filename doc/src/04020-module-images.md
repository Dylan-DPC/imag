## Images {#sec:modules:images}

The Images module is for tagging, categorizing and sorting images. GPS coordinates can be attached to image references. Images can be put into collections. Image viewing programs can be called from imag. If an image gets modified (for example via darktable) and a new image file is created, the Image module can be used to group them.
