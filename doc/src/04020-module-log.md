## Log {#sec:modules:log}

The "imag-log" module is a lightweight interface to the "imag-diary" command.

It is intended as a tumbeblog-like diary, where one does not care to fire up
an editor and type in a long text, but rather type a few words and forget
about it:

```
imag log --to work "Copying large amounts of data takes time"
```

Everything which can be done with `imag-log` can also be done with
`imag-diary`.
