# Todo

This section contains long-term todos. Some kind of roadmap, of one wants to put it that way.

## Modules

Modules imag should offer which are not yet started or in progress, including a short note what each module should do.

First the modules which have been implemented in some way (not necessarily perfect or feature-complete):

- [x] imag-bookmark - A bookmark manager for web browsing.
- [x] imag-diary - A diary, or multiple.
- [x] imag-counter - Counting things.
- [x] imag-link - Linking imag entries to eachother
- [x] imag-notes - Note taking
- [x] imag-ref - Refering to files outside the imag store.
- [x] imag-tag - Tagging imag entries
- [x] imag-view - Viewing imag entries

Now the modules that are not yet started:

- [ ] imag-bibliography - For handling bibliographic references when writing scientific papers. Like Citavi, for example.
- [ ] imag-borrow - If you lend something to someone.
- [ ] imag-calendar - Calendar tooling based on icalendar files. No sync functionality.

- [ ] imag-contact - Contact tooling baed on vcard files. No sync functionality.
- [ ] imag-cuecards - Cuecards for learning things, for example vocabulary.
- [ ] imag-filter - command to read the store from stdin, filter out entries based on a predicate specified via the CLI and write the store back to stdout.
- [ ] imag-git wrapper to call git commands on the imag store no matter whether the current working directory is the store or not

- [ ] imag-project - A project planner, integrated with imag-timetrack and imag-todo
- [ ] imag-rate - Attaching a rating to an entry
- [ ] imag-read - Command to load the store and pipe it to stdout (usefull for piping/ chaining commands)
- [ ] imag-receipt - Creating, categorizing, managing receipts

- [ ] imag-write - Command to read the store from stdin and write it to the filesystem store (usefull for piping/ chaining commands)

## Libraries

- [ ] Ensure all libraries are implemented as extension traits rather than wrapping store types
- [ ] Rewrite logger to allow config/env-var based module white/blacklisting and writing log to file

## User Interface

- [ ] Ensure store ids are always passed as positional arguments

## Project structure and development

- [ ] Move away from github
  - [ ] Have own issue tracking (possibly git-dit)
  - [ ] Find a solution to having no travis-ci via github anymore

  - [ ] Setup a viewer for the mailinglist archive
