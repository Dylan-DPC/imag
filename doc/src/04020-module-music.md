## Music {#sec:modules:music}

The Music module is for rating, categorizing, tagging and enjoying music. It offers functionality to fetch lyrics, create automatically linkings from genre entries to music files (music files are represented as a entry jn imag), combining songs in albums and albums in artists, etc.

A scrobble server may be implemented at some point to provide more ways to retrieving data over ones music taste. Suggested songs (from the own library of music or via external tools like musicbrainz) may be a feature that comes aith the scrobble server.
