## Item {#sec:modules:item}

The Item module is a plumbing command to create entries for items in the imag store.

Items can be anything. For example, one could create a Tomato and a Bread as item to add them later in the shopping list (as in imag-shoppinglist), but also a computer and a printer can be created to use them later in a project (as in imag-project).
