## Project {#sec:modules:project}

The Project module can be used to plan and organize projects, though does not offer ways to share these plans with others. If that is desired, a new store should be created, put under version controll (possibly git) and shared via this mechanism.

The project tool integrates the timetracking module as well as the todo module.

A project is represented by a single imag entry. Notes, subprojects, todos, timetrackings and other things are linked to the project. A project does not necessarily have to be a programming project, but could be a project for building a house or losing weight for example.
