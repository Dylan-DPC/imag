# Libraries {#sec:libraries}

This section of the documentation is only relevant for developers and you might
skip it if you're only a user of the imag tool.

The following sections contain a short documentation on what the several
libraries are supposed to do.
It is generated from the `README.md` files of each library and only gives a
general overview what can be done with the library.
For a more comprehensive documentation of the library, one might consult the
appropriate documentation generated from the source of the library itself.

The documentation of the libraries is sorted _alphabetically_.
