## libimagerror

In imag, we do not panic.

Whatever we do, if we fail as hard as possible, the end-user should _never ever_
see a backtrace from a `panic!()`.

Anyways, the user _might_ see a error trace generated by imag.
That is because imag is software for power-users, for nerds (I use the term
"nerd" because for me it is a good thing - I do not want to offend anyone by
using it).
This target group can read backtraces without getting confused. `IO Error` and
`Permission denied Error` are things that nerds can understand and they already
know what to do in the most obvious cases (such as `Permission denied Error`).

This library crate is for generating error types and handle them in a nice way.
It can be seen as mini-framework inside imag which was written to work with
error types in a specified way. All imag crates _must_ use this library if they
can return errors in any way, except the `libimagutil` - which is for the most
basic utilities.
