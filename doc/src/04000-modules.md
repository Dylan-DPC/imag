# Modules {#sec:modules}

A module is a functionality of the program.
There is a huge list of modules available in the imag core distribution.

From a naming perspective, we do not differ between low-level and high-level
modules. Some of the modules shipped with imag cover core functionality such as
linking, tagging or references to files outside of the store or even the store
interface itself (which by the way shouldn't be used by the end-user at all).
Others cover things like diary, notes, wiki or bookmarks.

The modules try to offer a consistent commandline user interface.
