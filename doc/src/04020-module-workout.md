## Workout {#sec:modules:workout}

The Workout module is for tracking workouts. Burned calories, walked kilometers, lifting sets and all the things can be entered.

### Submodules

Each type of workout can be handled with one subcommand of the module, whereas training seasions can be used to group types of workouts (for example swimming and running).

A step-counter functionality is implemented as first submodule.
Import functionality for the step-counter submodule is available for importing from (for example) an Android step-counter App.
