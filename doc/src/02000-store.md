# The Store {#sec:thestore}

## File Format {#sec:thestore:fileformat}

The content in the store MUST BE encoded in either Unicode UTF-8 or ASCII.
Each "Entry" (File) MUST HAVE a "Header" component as well as a "Content"
component.
Each "Entry" in the store MUST start with three single dashes ("-") followed
by a newline character, named "initial marker" in the following chapter.
The Header follows the initial marker (@sec:thestore:fileformat:header).
The Header MUST BE followed by a line which contains three single dashes ("-")
and a newline character, called "header-close marker" in the following
chapter.
The content follows the header-close marker (@sec:thestore:fileformat:content).

### Header Format {#sec:thestore:fileformat:header}

The header format MUST BE "TOML".
The contents of the header contain

1. A section called "imag", where the automatically by the program generated
   data goes to.
   The contents of these sections are edited via commandline calls or by the
   program implicitely and SHOULD NOT be edited by the user.
   The section MAY BE empty.
1. Other OPTIONAL sections which are named and edited by the user. The program
   MUST NOT touch the contents of these sections, except explicitely asked by
   the user to do so.

### Content Format {#sec:thestore:fileformat:content}

The content is the part of the file where the user is free to enter any
textual content.
The content MAY BE rendered as Markdown or other markup format for the users
convenience.
The program SHOULD NOT expect any particular markup format, except explicitely
configured in the header of the file.
