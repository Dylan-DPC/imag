# libimagentryfilter

Helper library to filter lists of entries by certain predicated. Offers filters
for filtering by header values and other predicates, plus this library offers
logical operants to combine filters.

A commandline-to-filter DSL is planned for this, so commandline applications can
use this to implement a uniform filter interface.
